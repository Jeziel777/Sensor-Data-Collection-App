        "in the creation of these maintenance systems. One there are better " +

        "the maintenance and renewal of cycle ways, greenways, and footpaths. \n" +

        "Incorporating a more convenient and better way for the public to report " +
        "issues that incorporates automation, may also lead to problems on path " +
        "actually getting fixed. People who previously wouldn't have bothered, " +
        "may now report it. The more people who report, the more likely it is to be fixed. \n" +

        "If authorities are better informed on issues, they are more likely to " +

        "Overall, overcoming the problems of no budgets, no maintenance programs, " +
        "poor reporting systems, lack of automation etc. will address our societal " +
